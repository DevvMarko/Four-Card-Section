## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

Using SASS to style my site made my job a lot easier. I also used a CSS grid for the first time where I had trouble with the spacing between the cards in the center column, but I used a CSS grid generator and fixed my problem.


### Continued development

In the next project we will use Bootstrap to create an easier and faster responsive website.
